When you open the planner
The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

When you scroll down
You are presented with time blocks for standard business hours

When you click into a time block
Then you can enter an event

Still Working on these:
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
